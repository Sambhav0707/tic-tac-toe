# Tic Tac Toe

A simple and fun **Tic Tac Toe** game built with Flutter! This project demonstrates Flutter's UI capabilities and showcases the basics of state management while creating an interactive and engaging game.

## Introduction

**Tic Tac Toe** is a classic two-player game, where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent does. This app provides:

- A user-friendly and responsive design.
- Two modes: 
  - **Player vs Player**
  - **Player vs AI (coming soon!)**.
- A restart game functionality.

It's a great starting point to explore Flutter and game development!
